Title:*************PYthon amazing calculator****************************


link to the program output: 

**Description:

This is a mini project using python programming language to build a standard calculator which can keep track of the previous outputs and calculations! This calculator also has an inbuilt quadratic polynomial solver using the sympy module. The program is written in such a way that even if you make an error inputting something the program won't crash. It is highly user freindly and easy to navigate.

**Objective:

The objective of this program is to put into use various basic concepts such as OOP's, data types and math operations to built an amazing user friendly calculator. Just run the calculator_demo.py file to run the program (this is the main file). 


**Customization:

You can customize this project in any way possible, here sky is not even the limit!!. You can make this calculator into a scientific calculator which can solve differnetaial equations! or may be you want to create a calculator which display's the graph of any math function that you can think of!


**Challenges: 
There is no challenge involved! this is just for fun unlike my other projects!



**Python game: 

This program is entirely built on python. It showcases a classical . This project is a perfect example of showcasing basic python coding skills to built an amazing tool such as a calculator for fun or for educational purpose!
